\chapter{Calculation of the AC-Stark-Shift}

The calculation of the \textsc{ac}-Stark-Shift is done, using the formulas resulting from pertubation theory, as carried out in the previous sections. The first part of this chapter reviews the main results regarding the polarizabilities of the ground and first excited state. This will reveal also whether the excited state can also be trapped in the high intensity region of the lasers and how the trapping compares to that of the ground state. All calculations use the computer algebra system mathematica.\\For the meassurement, testing the theoretical foundation, that is presented in this thesis, concrete shift calculations are made regarding the big, crossed dipole trap. At the end of this section, values for the small microtrap will be presented, that will suggest, in how far the goal of imaging atoms in small traps and single sites of optical lattices can be managed.

\section{Polarizability}
For the calculation of the polarizabilities for the respective states, the geometry and power of the used laser-beams are not important, since it only depends on the wavelength of the incoming light and on its polarization, that is rather important in the vicinity of a reonance and renders unimportant, when using very far detuined trap-light. Before talking about concrete results, we recall the formulas given in the theory-section.
