\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}

The goal of the calculations and measurements was and is to evaluate the possibility of single site resolved imaging in the microtrap and optical lattices. In the framework of this experiment the specific question was, whether Lithium-6 atoms in the excited state are also trapping, meaning, that the dipole force acts towards the bigger intensity, as for the ground state. Furthermore the question remains, whether this force is strong enough to hold the atoms in the trap over the imaging process, while absorbing and emitting enough photons to make the fluorescence bright enough to see it in a camera. The first result is, which was also proven in the experiment, that the excited state of the D_2-line is indeed trapping and the dipole force for the same parameters of the used trap is around two thirds of that acting on the ground state.

The interesting question now is whether that is enough to keep the
