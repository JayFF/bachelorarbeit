\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}

The goal of this thesis was to determine the \textsc{ac}-Stark shift in order to evaluate the possibilities of spatially resolved imaging of single atoms in our microtrap setup. It was calculated and measured in the experiment using our crossed dipole trap. The experimental values proved to be in good consistency with the underlying theory. A summary of the results:

For the Lithium-6 ground and excited states ($2s_{1/2}$ and $2p_{3/2}$) the potential of our dipole trap results in an attractive force. This force is weaker for the excited state. At the used wavelength of 1064 nm the potential depth for the excited state is as much as 77 \% compared to the ground state depth for $|m_J|=1/2$ and 65 \% for $|m_J|=3/2$ respectively. For the used transition this results in 1 up bto 1400 photon recoil energies, depending on the power of the trap beams. Since the kinetic energy should rise linearly to the number ob the scattered photons \cite{guck das nach Jonathan!}, this gives also the number of photons, scattered before the atom leaves the trap, because of heating. 

Our objective, that is used to catch the fluorescence emission has 10 \% solid angle coverage. The used EMCCD camera (Andor Stuff, muss nochmal nachschauen) is claimed to allow single photon sensitivity. To get a discernible signal we estimate that we should capture at least 10 photons per atom, which would correspond to 100 scattering events. Considering the maximum depth of the trap site-resolved imaging of single atoms should therefore be possible





%In the framework of this experiment the specific question was, whether Lithium-6 atoms in the excited state are also trapping, meaning, that the dipole force acts towards the bigger intensity, as for the ground state. Furthermore the question remains, whether this force is strong enough to hold the atoms in the trap over the imaging process, while absorbing and emitting enough photons to make the fluorescence bright enough to see it in a camera. The first result is, which was also proven in the experiment, that the excited state of the D_2-line is indeed trapping and the dipole force for the same parameters of the used trap is around two thirds of that acting on the ground state.
