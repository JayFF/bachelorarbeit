\chapter{The Experiment}


The key feature of the experiment is the possibility to prepare few atoms in a microscopic dipole trap with high fidelity. For this, we have to prepare a degenerate quantum gas of fermionic Lithium-6 atoms. A brief summary of our apparatus and the preparation scheme is given in this chapter. A more detailed description can be found in \cite{friedhelm}. 

After vaporizing Lithium in an oven, the first component of the experiment is the Zeeman slower, that cools the sample before trapping it in the \textsc{mot}. The slower is essentially a large tube behind the oven shutter (see figure \ref{experiment}), surrounded by coils. A strong laser beam is pointing along the slower in the opposite direction of the flying atoms. When being in resonance with an atomic transition, the photons get absorbed and the atoms are pushed in the direction of the laser. Because spontaneous emission is directed in random directions, this leads to slowing of the cloud. During their deceleration, the transition frequency of the atoms is Doppler-shifted with respect to the laser beam. Therefore a spatially varying magnetic field shifts the atoms back into resonance by use of the Zeeman effect.

Trough the view ports lasers for the \textsc{mot} and dipole-trap enter the chamber, (see figure \ref{scheme}). It is surrounded by coils providing magnetic field for several stages of the process. On the right one can see the oven and the Zeeman-slower connecting both parts.}

After leaving the Zeeman slower, the atoms are captured in a magneto-optical trap (\textsc{mot})
It consists of six counter-propagating near-resonant laser beams. The usage of many retro-reflected beams in different directions makes it possible not only to force the atoms in a certain direction, but to also affect all particles with a high absolute velocity. This reduces the overall average-speed and therefore cools the gas. However, since the force of the laser beams alone is only velocity-dependent, slow particles would exit the center of the crossed beams over time. For this reason a magneto-optical trap uses a magnetic quadrupole-field, that has zero strength in the middle and increases when moving further away from the center. The Zeeman-effect shifts the level-distance for the out moving atoms towards the frequency of the laser, which will then apply a force, dependent on the spatial position, enabling not only cooling but trapping and compression of the gas-sample. The natural linewidth of the used transition limits the cooling of the \textsc{mot} to a temperature of around 140$\mu \mathrm{K}$. The system used in this experiment can store around 10‚Å∏ atoms. 

However, to obtain a degenerate Fermi gas, the temperature has to be reduced much further. The next step on this ladder is the crossed dipole trap.

It uses the laser beam of a 200 \textsc{w} Ytterbium fiber-laser (\textsc{ipg ylr-200-lp}) that is far red-detuned from the atomic transitions at 1070 nm. The beam's focus lies within the \textsc{mot}, with a waist of approximately 40 \mu m \cite{lompe} (see figure \ref{scheme}). After leaving the vacuum chamber, a mirror system guides the laser beam back at a different angle, forming the crossed trap shape. To trap as many atoms as possible, the laser is ramped-up to full power, generating a trap depth of more than 3 mK. To further cool the sample, the power is slowly ramped down, so the hottest atoms escape the potential and the rest of the cloud thermalizes at a lower temperature (evaporative cooling \cite{metcalf}).

 A small, tightly focused infrared laser-beam at 1064 nm, that intersects the crossed dipole-trap then forms the microtrap (\textsc{mephisto S} from Innolight). The small dimensions of the trap result in large spacing between the allowed vibrational levels. To control the atom number in the microtrap, a magnetic field gradient tilts the dipole-potential. That leads to the escape of all atoms above a certain level. It allows the preparation of 1 to 10 particles with fidelities of over 90\% \cite{preparation}.

\section{Imaging}

At different stages of the experiment, the atoms can be imaged by different methods. While absorption imaging is used for diagnostics, we rely on fluorescence imaging for our experiments.

\subsection{Absorption imaging}

Absorption imaging is a common method to image clouds of atoms\cite{ketterle}. A resonant beam is pointed on a camera, through the sample, and partly gets absorbed. Therefore a shadow is visible on the sensor, that shows the density distribution along the cloud. In the classical regime, where the Fermi gas is not degenerate, a Gaussian can be fitted to this distribution to obtain the atom number. When the gas is degenerate and follows Fermi statistics, this no longer holds and the calculation gets more complicated. A detailed analysis can be found in \cite{ketterle2}.

In this setup we use a tunable, grating stabilized diode laser (Toptica \textsc{dl}-100). To get usable noise-free data three images has to be taken. The first is taken, when the actual imaging is done, with the atom cloud in the beam path. The next is taken when the atom cloud has cleared, with pure laser-light to account for noise of the light source. The last one is taken in the dark to account for disturbance of the ambient light. When both corrections are subtracted one gets a clear image of the atomic cloud.

The absorption not only depends on the density but also on the scattering cross section. For resonant light, the absorption is higher and by varying the wavelength of the laser, the resonance frequency of the transition can be found.

However, this method is not suitable for resolving single atoms, because for that, a certain density is necessary. For this, one has to rely on the more basic fluorescence imaging.

\subsection{fluorescence imaging}

Our current method of imaging single photons is using the \textsc{mot} to recapture the atoms after releasing them from the deactivated microtrap \cite{timo}. The trapping light gets absorbed and the resulting fluorescence is caught on a \textsc{ccd}-camera. the amount of captured light is used to determine the atom number, which is possible with high fidelity. The current imaging setup needs long exposure times of about one second and all atoms from each microtrap is captured in the same \textsc{mot}. Therefore no spatial resolution is possible.

The next step will be imaging the atoms inside the microtrap, to compensate the disadvantage of the current setup. Instead of a \textsc{mot} the atoms are excited in a non-trapping optical molasse. A retro-reflected resonant laser beam intersects the dipole trap and the emitted photons are once again captured, in this setup using a high numerical aperture objective and an EMCCD-camera, that allows single photon sensitivity. By holding the atoms in the trap, the fluorescence not only allows counting the number, but to see the position of the single particles.
