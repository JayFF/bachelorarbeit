\caption{Resonance peak for the transition: $2s\rightarrow2p_{3/2}, m_j=+3/2$ at 1070 nm. The power at this meassurement was 12.35 W. The scale shows frequencies of the voltrage-controlled oscillator determning the detuning of the laser and is fixed arbitrairily. It therefore shows only the relative shift. A Lorentzian function (red) was fitted to the values, whose parameters were used to determine the center position of the peak. In the range, where the laser was effectivly off-resonance the seen atom-cloud lost its gaussian profile, and therefore no fit was possible to determine the atom number. This accounts for the high errors in this range.}

The measurement of the \textsc{ac}-Stark shift is done in the crossed dipole-trap. For technical reasons the magnetic field was at 527 G for every measurement. As calculated before this should not change the behaviour of the light shift significantly. To find the resonance peak in the respective setting the atom number is meassured using absorbtion imaging. The frequency of the imaging-laser is hereby scanned over the considered resonance, taking an image for every step in detuning. To find the differential light shift, the pictures are taken either with the activated dipole-trap or with the laser-beams turned off, leaving minimum time of flight in order to get significant results. For the imaging the $D_2$-line was used, that corresponds to the transition from  $2s\rightarrow2p_{3/2}$. The imaging laser was $\sigma^+$-polarized. Therefore the excited state was in the magnetic sublevel $m_j=+3/2$. The resonance frequency of this transition is 670.977 nm. Since the excited state is expected to be shifted less strong than the ground state, the energy difference should decrease, leading to a lower resonance frequency and a higher resonance wavelength. The shift is expected to be 0.175\pm 0.060 MHz/W and therefore the resonance frequency for 12.35 W should be 4.3\pm 1.5 MHz lower, when activating the dipoletrap. The resulting graph for this power can be seen in figure \ref{resonance}. To compare the behaviour as well as the exact values with the theory, different powers were measured and plotted in figure \ref{shifts}.

\caption{Comparison of the differential light-shift in theory (red) and experiment (black) for the D2-line. Note, that the scales show the initial laser-powers. The power in the middle of the trap itself is twice as strong. As is visible in this plot, the errors for the measured shifts are very small compared to that of the calculated value. This supports the assumption, that the error is mostly systematic and can be removed in comparrison with the measured results.}
\label{shifts}
\end{figure}


As can be seen in figure \ref{shifts} the shifts show a linear behaviour. The fit was fixed at ($P=0, \Delta E_\mathrm{dif}=0$) and still shows a very good result. The slope is $0.3274\pm 0.0013\unit{MHz/W}$ of initial beam-power. For a more general statement the value is also given in terms of the intensity:

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Measured differential shift in terms of intensity.}
\label{shiftintens}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_\mathrm{dif}/I=0.4426\pm 0.0028\unit{MHz\frac{1}{mW/\mu m^2}}
\end{equation}
Using this value, we also can calculate the trap depth, when knowing the relation of both polarizabilities for gound and excited states. The formula is derived using the fact, that the relation between the polarizabilities and thus the lightshifts is constant for every power.
\begin{align}
U_{\mathrm{g}}=&-\frac{1}{1-\alpha_{\mathrm{e}}/\alpha_{\mathrm{g}}}\cdot \Delta E_\delta\\
U_{\mathrm{e}}=&-\frac{1}{1-\alpha_{\mathrm{g}}/\alpha_{\mathrm{e}}}\cdot \Delta E_\delta
\end{align}
In this case $\Delta E_\delta$ stands for the relative shift of the levels relative to each other, i.e. the shift of the resonance. The results of the experiment translate into depths of the trap potential for the ground and excited state with the following values:
\begin{align}
U_g/I=&-(120.32\pm 0.48)\unit{\mu K\ k_B\frac{1}{mW/\mu m^2}}\\
U_e/I=&-(78.05\pm 0.31)\unit{\mu K\ k_B\frac{1}{mW/\mu m^2}}
\end{align}
Also the measurement can make it possible to find values for other quantities of the trap. The waist of the trap beam for example is usually not exactly easy to measure, in contrast to its power, that we know with good precision.
\begin{align}
I=&\frac{\epsilon_0 c}{\alpha}\cdot U\\\notag\\
w_0=&\sqrt{\frac{2P}{\pi I}}
\end{align}
In this calculation $I$ is the actual maximum-intensity forming the potential and $P$ the initial laser-power in the trap. For the crossed dipole-trap this results in the following waist.
\begin{equation}
w_0=41.383\pm 0.082\unit{\mu m}
\end{equation}
The approximate value used for the calculation, taken from \cite{lompe} was 40\mu m.

\subsection{Microtrap parameters}

Trusting the tested theory we now can calculate the depth for the microtrap in that the fluorescence imaging is meant to be implemented. The current waist of the trap is 1.3 $\mu$m using laser power of 400 $\mu$\textsc{w}. This leads to a trap depth of
\begin{align}
U_g=&-(6.03\pm 0.61)\unit{\mu K}\ k_B\\
U_e=&-(3.90\pm 0.39)\unit{\mu K}\ k_B
\end{align}
Assuming a 5\%-error on the beams waist. We can use $p_\gamma=h/\lambda$ and $T_{Li}=p^2/2m_{Li}$ to calculate the kinetic energy of an excited Lithium-6 atom. The trap depth corresponds roughly to the momentum of only a single photon, that is re-emitted in a random direction. Therefore the trap is not deep enough for holding an atom for enough absorption events to actually measure the fluorescence. However, it is possible in our setup to ramp the laser power up to about 500 mW, that would correspond to the energy of about 1400 photon recoil energies.
\begin{align}
U_g=&-(7.54\pm 0.76)\unit{mK}\ k_B\\
U_e=&-(4.88\pm 0.49)\unit{mK}\ k_B
\end{align}
